## Internet Ping Monitor
This is a internal application I wrote to debug some internet intermitent issues. The usage is really simple. Install the package globally with git
`npm i -g git+https://github.com/wallsmetalroofing/wmr-internet-ping`
and run this command to monitor said ip addresses.
`ping-monitor 192.168.1.1 8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1`
